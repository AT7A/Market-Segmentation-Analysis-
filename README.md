# Market-Segmentation-Analysis-

This project centers on market segmentation analysis to identify distinct customer groups for McDonald's based on demographics, behavior, and preferences. 
A comparison of K-means and GMM clustering assessed the stability of the results. These data-driven insights enable McDonald's to tailor marketing strategies and offerings for different segments, enhancing the overall dining experience.
